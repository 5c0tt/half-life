#Medication half life calculator
Give a medications half life, will calculate how long it takes the average person to metabolize all the medication from their system,

I need to add in things like if they have a slow, medium, fast, extra fast metabolism, and also build a site around the entire thing to help others with this issue.

For the time being, it will resist here.
